### Agile Planning

* This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features in incrementally with a three phase loop.

* Stories were assigned to epics, prioritized under the Todo, In progress, and Done. They were assigned to track and monitor the progress of the project and stories allocated accordingly to the complexity. "Todo" stories is where I have listed the 'to do' stories lines, and "In progress" is where I have on-going work work in the tast mangement listed, likewise 'Done list', where I have the task completed.

* The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/email2ify/projects/12) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. All stories except the documentation tasks have a full set of acceptance criteria in order to define the functionality that marks that story as complete.
